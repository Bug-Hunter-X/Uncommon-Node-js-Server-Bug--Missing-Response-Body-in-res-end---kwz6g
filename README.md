# Uncommon Node.js Server Bug: Missing Response Body in res.end()

This repository demonstrates a subtle bug in a Node.js HTTP server where the absence of a response body in `res.end()` can cause unexpected behavior. The server won't crash or throw an error, but clients might hang indefinitely waiting for a response.

## Bug Description
The issue arises when the `res.end()` method is called without providing a response body. This can lead to unpredictable behavior, especially in production environments, making it difficult to debug.

## How to Reproduce
1. Clone this repository.
2. Run `node bug.js`.
3. Try to make a request to `http://localhost:3000`.  You might see a hanging request.

## Solution
The solution involves always including a response body, even if it's an empty string, to ensure proper communication with the client.  See `bugSolution.js` for the corrected code.

## Lessons Learned
This bug highlights the importance of careful error handling and consistent practices in server-side development. Always sending a response, even if it is an empty response, helps prevent unpredictable behavior and makes debugging easier.
